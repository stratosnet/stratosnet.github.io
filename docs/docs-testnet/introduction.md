# Introduction

The purpose of mesos Testnet is to validate all the technical design and network topology that can achieve the goal of our project â€” to provide a fully decentralized high-efficiency storage. On mesos testnet we will continue all the testing we employed on testnet; in addition, we will try to ensure the network is functional as in the real world, to build an environment as close to the mainnet as possible.

Our goal for the mesos testnet is to ensure we can migrate to the mainnet smoothly and provide powerful decentralized storage to real corporate world users.
