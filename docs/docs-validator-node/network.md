=== "Mesos Testnet"

    Mesos Testnet replicates the Stratos Mainnet, which is to be used for testing. Testnet coins are separate and distinct from actual tokens/assets, and are never supposed to have any value. This allows application developers or validators/testers to experiment, without having to use real assets or worrying about breaking the main Stratos chain.

    The documentation corresponding contains details for the RPC - HTTP, WS endpoints. There is also a full node setup if you wish to setup your own full node.
