## Configure Stratos on Metamask

In order to view the flow of funds in your accounts, on the Stratos Network, you will need to configure Stratos `{testnet, mainnet}` URL on Metamask.

    > **_NOTE:_** This is a Testnet network, don't send your mainnet Stratos from exchanges!!!

    To add Stratos's Testnet, click on the Network selection dropdown and then click on Custom RPC.<br/><br/>

    It will open up a form with 2 tabs on the top, Settings and Info. In the Settings tab you can add the URL `TODO`.
