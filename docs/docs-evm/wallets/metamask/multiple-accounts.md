In case you are new to Ethereum and Metamask, here is a guide on how to create multiple accounts:

To create multiple accounts, you click on Profile icon on Metamask and then click on Create Account<br/><br/>

![Create accounts](../../../assets/metamask/create-accounts.png)

You can then add an account name and click on Create.<br/><br/>

![Create new account](../../../assets/metamask/create-new-account.png)

You can create more accounts this way. When you create multiple accounts, your addresses will be different at your end.
