## **Setting up the development environment**

There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following:

- [Node.js v8+ LTS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (comes with Node)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Once we have those installed, we only need one command to install Truffle:

    npm install -g truffle

To verify that Truffle is installed properly, type **`truffle version`** on a terminal. If you see an error, make sure that your npm modules are added to your path.

> If you're new to Truffle then please follow the [Getting Started](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/quickstart) by truffle, To setup the truffle environment. 

## **truffle-config**

- Go to truffle-config.js
- Update the truffle-config with stratos-network-crendentials.

```js
const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');
const fs = require('fs');
const mnemonic = fs.readFileSync(".secret").toString().trim();

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",     // Localhost (default: none)
      port: 8545,            // Standard Ethereum port (default: none)
      network_id: "*",       // Any network (default: none)
    },
    // mainnet
    stratos: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `TODO`),
      network_id: 2048,
      confirmations: 1,
      timeoutBlocks: 200,
      skipDryRun: true
    },
    // testnet
    testnet: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `TODO`),
      network_id: 2047,
      confirmations: 1,
      timeoutBlocks: 200,
      skipDryRun: true
    },
  },

  // Set default mocha options here, use special reporters etc.
  mocha: {
    // timeout: 100000
  },

  // Configure your compilers
  compilers: {
    solc: {
    }
  }
}
```

Notice, it requires mnemonic to be passed in for stratos/testnet Provider, this is the seed phrase for the account you'd like to deploy from. Create a new .secret file in root directory and enter your 12 word mnemonic seed phrase to get started. To get the seedwords from metamask wallet you can go to Metamask Settings, then from the menu choose Security and Privacy where you will see a button that says reveal seed words. 

## **Deploying on Stratos Network**

Run this command in root of the project directory:
```js
$ truffle migrate --network testnet
```

Contract will be deployed on Stratos's Testnet, it look like this:
