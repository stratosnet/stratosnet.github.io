```

<br>

---

## `rp` or `registerpeer`
Register a Resource Node to an SP(meta) node.

Example:

```yaml
>rp
>[INFO] 2023/01/11 19:10:45 register_new_pp.go:25: get RspRegisterNewPP
[INFO] 2023/01/11 19:10:45 register_new_pp.go:31: get RspRegisterNewPP RES_SUCCESS 
[INFO] 2023/01/11 19:10:45 register_new_pp.go:40: registered as PP successfully, you can deposit by `activate`
```

!!! tip

    After receiving the response `registered as PP successfully, you can deposit by activate`, you can execute the next `activate` command to activate your resource node.

    `rp` or `registerpeer` command may raise an error because of its CPU chips which are not supported by SDS currently. For instance


```yaml
# Run on Macs with an Arm-based M1 chip

>rp
[ERROR]2022/04/15 11:38:22 service.go:185: RPC method sds_registerPP crashed: runtime error: index out of range [0] with length 0

```

<br>

---

## `activate`
Send transaction to Stratos chain to become an active Resource Node

```yaml
activate <amount> <fee> [--gas=gas] 
```

!!! tip

    `amount` is the amount of tokens you want to deposit. 1stos = 10^9gwei = 10^18wei.

    `fee` is the amount of tokens to pay as a fee for the activation transaction. 10000wei would work. It will use default value if not provide.

    `gas` is the amount of gas to pay for the transaction. 1000000 would be a safe number. It will use default value if not provide.

Example:

```yaml
>activate 2stos 0.01stos --gas=1000000
Request Accepted
[INFO] 2023/01/12 18:49:39 activate.go:66: get RspActivatePP RES_SUCCESS 
[INFO] 2023/01/12 18:49:41 activate.go:83: The activation transaction was broadcast

```

<br>

---

## `updateDeposit`
Update deposit of an active resource node.

```yaml
updateDeposit <depositDelta> <fee> [--gas=gas] 
```

!!! tip

    `depositDelta` is the absolute amount of difference between the original and the updated deposit. It should be a positive valid token, in the unit of `stos`/`gwei`/`wei`.

    When a resource node is suspended, use this command to update its state and re-start mining by increasing its deposit.

Example:

The following command will increase 1stos to deposit, use 10000gwei for tx fees and 1000000 for tx gas.

```yaml
>updateDeposit 1stos 1000000gwei --gas=1000000
Request Accepted
```

!!! tip

    When a resource node is `Mining: SUSPEND` due to poor performance(e.g., frequently offline, task uncompleted, unstable connection, unreachable node, etc.), use this command to update its state and re-start mining by increasing its deposit.

<br>

---

## `deactivate`
send transaction to Stratos-chain to stop being an active resource node

```yaml
deactivate <fee> [--gas=gas]
```

Example:

```yaml
>deactivate 10000000gwei --gas=1000000
```

<br>

---

## `startmining`(deprecated)
Resource node will start to receive tasks from meta nodes and thus gain mining rewards.
From SDS v0.7.0, user does not need to use this command any more since resource node will start mining automatically when the status of a resource node is `Mining: ONLINE`.

Example:
```yaml
startmining
```

<br>

---

## `prepay`
Ozone is the unit of traffic used by SDS. Operations involving network traffic require ozone to be executed.
User can always `prepay` stos to get Ozone any time before uploading/downloading files.

```yaml
prepay <amount> <fee> [--beneficiary=<beneficiary>] [--gas=<gas>]  
```

!!! tip

    `amount` is the amount of tokens you want to spend to purchase ozone.

    The other two parameters are the same as above.

Example:

```yaml
>prepay 1stos 6000000gwei --gas=6000000
Request Accepted
>[INFO] 2023/01/12 10:59:07 prepay.go:24: Sending prepay message to SP! st172v4u8ysfgaphjs8uyy0svvc6d6tzl6gp07kn4
[INFO] 2023/01/12 10:59:07 prepay.go:37: get RspPrepay RES_SUCCESS 
[INFO] 2023/01/12 10:59:09 prepay.go:46: The prepay transaction was broadcast

```

<br>

---

## `put`
upload a file. It will consume Ozone.

```yaml
put <filepath> [--isEncrypted=<isEncrypted>] [--nodeTier=<nodeTier>] [--allowHigherTier=<allowHigherTier>]
```
`filepath` is the location of the file to upload, starting from your resource node folder. It is better to be an absolute path.

Example:

```yaml
>put relayd/node1/relayd.toml
[INFO] 2023/01/12 12:00:05 requests.go:178: fileName~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ relayd.toml

## `putstream`
Upload a media file for streaming

Streaming is the continuous transmission of audio or video files(media files) from a server to a client.
In order to upload a streaming file, first you need to install a tool `ffmpeg` for transcoding multimedia files.

!!! note
    Please note that once a media file is uploaded via this command in streaming format, it is not allowed to be downloaded via regular get command in the current version. Instead, it has to be played through the APIs that are designed for playing streaming videos.

In Linux Terminal:

```yaml
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# use ffmpeg -version to check its version
ffmpeg -version
```
In MacOS Terminal:

```yaml
brew update
brew install ffmpeg
```

<br>

Then, use `putstream` command to upload a media file

```yaml
putstream <filepath> [--nodeTier=<nodeTier>] [--allowHigherTier=<allowHigherTier>]
```

> `filepath` is the absolute path of the file to be uploaded, or a relative path starting from the root directory of the resource node.

Example:

```yaml
putstream example_01.mp4
```

<br>

---

## `list` or `ls`
List all uploaded files

```yaml
ls
```

<br>

---

## `list <filename>`
Query a specific uploaded file by name

```yaml
ls filename
```

Example:

```yaml
>ls relayd.toml

## `get`
Download an uploaded file

```yaml
get <sdm://account/filehash> [saveAs]
```

!!! tip

    Every file uploaded to SDS is attributed with a unique file hash.

    View the file hash for each of your files when you `list` your uploaded files.

    Use the optional parameter `saveAs` to rename the file.

    The downloaded files will be saved into the folder `download` by default under the root directory of your resource node, like

``` { .yaml .no-copy }
.
âââ accounts
âÂ Â  âââ st1la7aj36gk88puz3026t3mkqfeu4q8paj3rs4gk.json

## `sharefile`
Share(public) an uploaded file

```yaml
sharefile <filehash> <duration> <is_private>
```

!!! tip

    `duration` is time period(in seconds) when the file share expires. Put `0` for unlimited time.

    `is_private` is whether the file share should be protected by a password. Put `0` for public file without password, and `1` for private file with a password.

    After this command has been executed successfully, SDS will provide a password to this shared file, like `m216`.Please keep this password for future use.

Example:

```yaml
>sharefile v05ahm51l6v6tm2vqc682b9sicom61fgkoqdl0pg 0 1
Request Accepted

## `getsharefile`
Download a shared file.

```yaml
getsharefile <sharelink> [password]
```

!!! tip

    Leave the `password` blank if it's a public shared file.

    `sharelink` could be found when your use `allshare` to list all available shared files.

    The downloaded files will be saved into the folder `download` by default under the root directory of your resource node.

## `status`
Query the current status of a resource node.

```yaml
status
```

Example:
```yaml

Request Accepted
>[INFO] 2023/01/12 10:57:01 get_pp_status.go:80: *** current node status ***
Activation: Active | Registration Status: Registered | Mining: ONLINE | Initial tier: 1 | Ongoing tier: 1 | Weight score: 5480
```

!!! tip

    `Activation` indicates the activation state of a resource node, including `Active`, `Inactive` and `Unbonding`.

    `Registration` indicates the registration of a resource node, including `Unregistered`, `Registering` and `Registered`.

    `Mining` indicates the mining state of a resource node, including `ONLINE`, `OFFLINE`, `SUSPEND` and `MAINTENANCE`.

    When a resource node becomes `Mining: SUSPEND` due to its poor performance, user may use `updateDeposit` command to update its state and re-start mining by increasing its deposit.

    Meta Node assigns a `Weight score` to Resource Node depending on its performance. The more `Weight score` a Resource Node has, the more priority it has to be assigned tasks.

<br>

## `maintenance start`
Claim a maintenance. Put the resource node in maintenance mode for the requested duration (in seconds).

```yaml
maintenance start <duration> 
```

!!! tip

    * `maintenance start <duration>` command starts a maintenance activity and switches the node into `maintenance` mode for the requested duration (in seconds);
    * While a Resource Node is in `maintenance` mode, it will be opt-out from any download/upload/backup tasks;
    * While a Resource Node is in `maintenance` mode, it will NOT be slashed for its off-line;
    * The maintenance allowance is maxed out after reach 1% up-time per year(around 87h). Then, any maintenance request will be rejected;
    * The maintenance allowance will be tracked and be reset every calendar year for all nodes;
    * When using the `maintenance stop` to stop the current maintenance, or the maintenance period is over, the node status reverts to `offline` and is ready to restart mining. It acts as usual to earn rewards or be slashed.

Example:

```yaml
>maintenance start 600
Request Accepted
>[INFO] 2023/01/12 12:57:21 maintenance.go:19: Sending maintenance start request to SP!
